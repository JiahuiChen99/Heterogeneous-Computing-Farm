\section{Yako} \label{yako}
     The implementation of the project is divided into two parts. On one hand, a back-end, where the orchestrator operates, where logic and computation take place. On the other hand, the front-end, a client that acts as a gateway to interact with all the computational resources available on the server side. A detailed description of all the fractions that comprises the project will be presented in the following sections.

    Figure \ref{fig:simple_architecture} represents the internal interconnection of the different components of the platform. An example of a more complex and extended system will be described at the end of this chapter on figure \ref{fig:complex_architecture}.

    \subsection{Run the system}
    
        This section describes the steps to run the Yako platform, both back-end and front-end software.
