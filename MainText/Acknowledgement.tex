\section{Acknowledgement} \label{chap-6}
    I would like to express my gratitude to both my supervisors, Dr. Joan Navarro Martín and Dra. Anna Carreras Coch, who mentored and offered guidance throughout the entire project. Dr. Daniel Amo Filvà deserves my thanks for proofreading the paper. I would also like to thank Ms. Watanabe Rika for supplying help to my inquiries and Mercari, Inc. for providing me with a premium Udemy account for my personal learning and growth, which I used during the realisation of the dissertation.
