# Heterogeneous Computing Farm

The popularity of cloud services is growing exponentially, on the one hand large technology
multinationals are investing millions in improving their infrastructure and services. On the
other hand, users are increasingly dependent on these services. However, we must not forget
that today we have at our disposal, devices for everyday use that exceed the performance of
computers that brought humans into space during the last century. These devices are part of
the periphery, the edge layer, and are often diverse in nature. We want to make use of this
computing power that would otherwise be wasted.The novelty results are twofold: an open-source orchestrator that handles heterogeneous computing agents; an open-source front-end
application to interact with these.
